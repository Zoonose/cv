                <p>I have always been attracted to the IT field, even from a young age.</p> 
                <p>I am mostly self-taught and have been using PC/Mac computers, gaming consoles, and gadgets my whole life. Over time, I developed a special interest in software and technology, with a particular focus on QA and Web development. </p> 
                <p>This interest has driven me to learn about testing methodologies, techniques, and to continually expand my knowledge. I have found Udemy to be a great resource, particularly their bootcamps. I also use my Utest account to practice and test my skills. After graduating college with a degree in Veterinary Nursing, I have been working in the field and it has been a great experience. It has taught me about veterinary science and technology, the importance of teamwork and social skills, and how to handle high-pressure situations.</p>
